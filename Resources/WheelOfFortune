An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
It’s better to be safe than sorry.
Better late than never.
Actions speak louder than words.
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
Don’t judge a book by its cover.
Cleanliness is next to Godliness.
The early bird catches the worm.
Where there’s a will, there’s a way.
If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
